# linked-list-implementation
Linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. 
It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. 
Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. 
This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.
